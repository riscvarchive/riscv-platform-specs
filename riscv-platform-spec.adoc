== Introduction
The platform specification defines a set of platforms that specify requirements
for interoperability between software and hardware. The Platform Policy <<spec_riscv_platform_policy>>
defines the various terms used in this platform specification. The platform
policy also provides the needed detail regarding the scope, coverage, naming,
versioning, structure, life cycle and compatibility claims for the platform
specification. It is recommended that readers get familiar with the platform
policy while reading this specification. All the requirements in this 
specification are MANDATORY unless specifically called out in the relevant 
sections. Any hardware platform seeking compatibility with the platform 
specification has to be self certified by the platform compatibility test 
suite (PCT). More details about the PCT are available in the platform policy 
specification.

Platforms are augmented with extensions for industry specific target
market verticals like “server”, “mobile”, “edge computing”, “machine-learning”
and “automotive”.

The platform specification currently defines two platforms:

* *OS-A Platform*: This specifies a rich-OS platform for
Linux/FreeBSD/Windows - flavors that run on enterprise and embedded class
application processors. The OS-A platform has a base feature set and extensions
as shown below: +
** *Base*
** *Server Extension*

* *M Platform*: This specifies an RTOS platform for bare-metal applications and
small operating systems running on a microcontroller. The M platform has a base
feature set and extensions as shown below: +
** *Base*
** *Physical Memory Protection (PMP) Extension*

The current version of this platform spec targets the standardization of
functionality available in S, U, VS and VU modes, and the standardization of
the SBI (Supervisory Binary Interface as defined in <<spec_sbi>>) between
Supervisor level (S-mode/VS-mode) and M-mode/HS-mode respectively.

// OS-A Platform

// Base feature set for OS-A Platform
=== Base
==== ISA Requirements
===== General

* This OS-A platform must comply with the RVA22U and RVA22S ISA profiles as
defined in the RISC-V ISA Profiles specification [11].
* A non-conforming extension that conflicts with a supported standard extensions
must satisfy at least one of the following:
** It must be disabled by default.
** The supported standard extension must be declared as unsupported in all
feature discovery structures used by software. This option is allowed only
if the standard extension is not required.
* All hart PMA regions for main memory must be marked as coherent.
* Memory accesses by I/O masters can be coherent or non-coherent with respect
to all hart-related caches.
[sidebar]
---

===== Supervisor mode
* sstatus
** sstatus.UBE must support the same access attribute (read-only or writable)
as mstatus.UBE.

* stvec
** Both direct and vectored modes must be supported.
** The alignment constraint for BASE fields must be at most 256B.

* scounteren
** Writeable bits must be implemented for all supported (not hardwired to zero)
hpmcounters.

* stval
** stval must not be hardwired to 0 and in all cases must be written with
non-zero and zero values as architecturally defined.

* satp
** For RV32, Bare and Sv32 translation modes must be supported.
** For RV64, Bare and Sv39 translation modes must be supported.

===== Hypervisor extension
* hstatus
** VTW bit must not be hardwired to 0.
** VTVM bit must not be hardwired to 0.

* hcounteren
** Writeable bits must be implemented for all supported (not hardwired to zero)
hpmcounters.

* htval
** htval must not be hardwired to 0 and in all cases must be written with
non-zero and zero values as architecturally defined.

* htinst/mtinst
** htinst and mtinst must not be hardwired to 0 and must be written with a
transformed instruction (versus zero) when defined and allowed architecturally.

* hgatp
** For RV32, Bare and Sv32x4 translation modes must be supported.
** For RV64, Bare and Sv39x4 translation modes must be supported.

* vstvec
** Both direct and vectored modes must be supported.
** The alignment constraint for BASE fields must be at most 256B.

* vstval
** vstval must not be hardwired to 0 and in all cases must be written with
non-zero and zero values as architecturally defined.

* vsatp
** For RV32, Bare and Sv32 translation modes must be supported.
** For RV64, Bare and Sv39 translation modes must be supported.

==== PMU

The RVA22 profile defines 32 PMU counters out-of-which first three counters are
defined by the privilege specification while other 29 counters are programmable.
The SBI PMU extension defines a set of hardware events that can be monitored
using these programmable counters. This section defines the minimum number of
programmable counters and hardware events required for an OS-A compatible
platform.

* Counters
** The platform does not require to implement any of the programmable counters.
* Events
** The platform does not require to implement any of the hardware events defined
in SBI PMU extensions.

==== Debug
The OS-A base platform requirements are the following:

- Implement resethaltreq
  * Rationale: Debugging immediately out of reset is a useful debug tool.
    The resethaltreq mechanism provides a standard way to do this.
- Implement the program buffer
  * Rationale: The program buffer is easier for most implementations than
    abstract access.
  * Rationale: Debuggers need to be able to insert ebreak instructions into
    memory and make sure that the ebreak is visible to subsequent instruction
    fetches.  Abstract access has no support for `fence.i` (or similar
    mechanisms).
- abstractcs.relaxedpriv must be 0
  * Rationale: Doing otherwise is a potential security problem.
- abstractauto must be implemented
  * Rationale: autoexecprogbuf allows faster instruction-stuffing.
  * Rationale: autoexecdata allows fast read/write of a region of memory.
- dcsr.mprven must be tied to 1
  * Rationale: Emulating two-stage table walks and PMP checks and endianness
    swapping is a heavy burden on the debugger.
- In textra, sselect must support the value 0 and either value 1 or 2 (or
both)
  * Rationale: There must be some way to limit triggers to only match in a
    particular user context and a way to ignore user context.
- If textra.sselect=1 is supported, the number of implemented bits of svalue
must be at least the number of implemented bits of scontext
  * Rationale: This allows matching on every possible scontext.
- If textra.sselect=2 is supported, the number of implemented bits of svalue
must be at least ASIDLEN to match every possible ASID
- In textra, mhselect must support the value 0. If the H extension is
supported then mhselect must also support either values 1 and 5 or values 2
and 6 (or all four)
  * Rationale: There must be some way to limit triggers to only match in a
    particular guest context and a way to ignore guest context.
- If textra.mhselect=1,5 are supported and if H is the number of implemented
bits of hcontext then, unless all bits of mhvalue are implemented, at least
H-1 bits of mhvalue must be implemented
  * Rationale: This allows matching on every possible hcontext (up to the limit
    of the field width).  It is H-1 bits instead of H because mhselect[2]
    provides one bit.
- If textra.mhselect=2,6 are supported, the number of implemented bits of
mhvalue must be at least VMIDLEN-1
  * Rationale: This allows matching on every possible VMID.  It is VMIDLEN-1
    instead of VMIDLEN because mhselect[2] provides one bit.
- Implement at least four mcontrol6 triggers that can support matching on PC
(select=0, execute=1, match=0) with timing=0 and full support for mode
filtering (vs, vu, m, s, u) for all supported modes and support for textra as
above
  * Rationale: The debugger needs breakpoints and 4 is a sufficient baseline.
- Implement at least four mcontrol6 triggers that can support matching on load
 and store addresses (select=0, match=0, and all combinations of load/store)
 with timing=0 and full support for mode filtering (vs, vu, m, s, u) for all
 supported modes and support for textra as above
  * Rationale: The debugger needs watchpoints and 4 is a sufficient baseline.
- Implement at least one trigger capable of icount and support for textra as
above for self-hosted single step needs this
- Implement at least one trigger capable of etrigger and support for textra as
above to catch exceptions
- Implement at least one trigger capable of itrigger and support for textra as
above to catch interrupts
- The minimum trigger requirements must be met for action=0 and for action=1
(possibly by the same triggers)
  * Rationale: The intent is to have full support for external debug and full
    support for self-hosted debug (though not necessarily at the same time).
    This can be provided via the same set of triggers or separate sets of
    triggers. External debug support for icount is unnecessary due to dcsr.step
    and is therefore called out separately.
- For implementations with multiple cores, support for at least one halt group
and one resume group (in addition to group 0)
  * Rationale: Allows stopping all harts (approximately) simultaneously which
    is useful for debugging MP software.
- dcsr.stepie must support the 0 setting. It is optional to support the 1
setting
  * Rationale: It is not generally useful to step into interrupt handlers.
- dcsr.stopcount and dcsr.stoptime must be supported and the reset value of
each must be 1
  * Rationale: The architecture has strict requirements on minstret which may
    be perturbed by an external debugger in a way that's visible to software.
    The default should allow code that's sensitive to these requirements to be
    debugged.

==== Interrupts and Timer

===== Timer support

* One or more ACLINT MTIMER devices are required for the OS-A platform.
* Platform must support a default ACLINT MTIME counter resolution of 10ns
  (i.e. an increment by 1 represents 10 ns).
* The ACLINT MTIME update frequency (i.e. hardware clock) must be between
  10 MHz and 100 MHz, and updates must be strictly monotonic.

[sidebar]
--
[underline]*_Implementation Note:_*
For example, if the MTIME counter update frequency (i.e. hardware clock) is
25 MHz then the MTIME counter would increment by 4 upon every hardware clock
tick for MTIME counter resolution of 10ns.
--

===== Interrupts Support

The OS-A platform must comply with one of the four interrupt support
categories described in following sub-sections. The hardware must support at
least one of the four interrupt categories while software must support all of

==== System Peripherals
===== UART/Serial Console

In order to facilitate the bring-up and debug of the low level initial 
platform, hardware is required to implement a UART port that confirms to the
following requirements and firmware must support the console using this UART:

* The UART register addresses are required to be aligned to 4 byte boundaries.
If the implemented register width is less than 4 bytes then the implemented
bytes are required to be mapped starting at the smallest address.
* The UART port implementation is required to be register-compatible with one
of the following:
** UART 16550 - MANDATORY 
** UART 8250 - DEPRECATED

==== Boot Process
- The base specification defines the interface between the firmware and the
operating system suitable for the RISC-V platforms with rich operating
systems.
- These requirements specify the required boot and runtime services, device
discovery mechanism, etc.
- The requirements are operating system agnostic, specific firmware/bootloader
implementation agnostic.
- For the generic mandatory requirements this base specification will refer to
the EBBR specification <<spec_ebbr>>. Any deviation from the EBBR will be 
explicitly mentioned in the requirements.


===== Firmware
====== Storage and Partitioning
- GPT partitioning required for shared storage.
- MBR support is not required.

===== Hardware Discovery Mechanisms
- Device Tree (DT) is the required mechanism for system description.
- Platforms must support the Unified Discovery specification for all pre-boot
information population <<spec_unified_discovery>>.


==== Runtime Services

===== SBI

* The M-mode runtime must implement SBI specification <<spec_sbi>> or higher.
* Required SBI extensions include:
** SBI TIME
** SBI IPI
** SBI RFENCE
** SBI HSM
** SBI SRST
** SBI PMU

===== UEFI

* Wherever applicable UEFI firmware must implement UEFI interfaces over
  similar interfaces and services present in the SBI specification. For
  example, the UEFI ResetSystem() service must be implemented via the
  SBI System Reset Extension.
* The operating system should prioritize calling the UEFI interfaces before
  the SBI or platform specific mechanisms.

==== Software and ABIs
The platform specification mandates the following requirements for
software components:

* All RISC-V software components must comply with the
  RISC-V procedure call standard <<spec_proc_call>>.
* All RISC-V software components that use ELF files must comply with the
  RISC-V ELF specification <<spec_elf>>.
* All RISC-V software components that use DWARF files must comply with the
  RISC-V DWARF specification <<spec_dwarf>>.

Rationale: The platform specification intends to avoid fragmentation and
promotes interoperability.

* To order older stores before younger instruction fetches, user-level programs must
use system-supplied library calls (e.g. GNU libc's `__riscv_flush_icache`, which
invokes the Linux kernel's corresponding vDSO routine), rather than executing
the `fence.i` instruction directly.

Rationale: The `fence.i` instruction only orders the current hart's instruction
fetches - which is insufficient even for single-threaded programs since a thread
may migrate to a different hart.

=== Security
** If M-mode is supported in the platform, all machine mode assets, such as
code and data, shall be protected from all non-machine mode accesses from the
harts in the system. Additionally, I/O agent access protection must be 
required within the system to protect machine mode assets. Therefore, the
following requirements are mandatory for platforms with M-mode:

*** Platform must provide a protection mechanism from non-machine mode hart
transactions that precisely traps if violated.
*** Platform must provide a protection mechanism from I/O agents manipulating
or accessing machine mode assets.

// Server extension for OS-A Platform
=== Server Extension
The server extension specifies additional requirements for server  class
platforms. The server extension includes all of the requirements for the
base with the additional requirements as below. The server extension, besides
placing additional requirements on top of the underlying base specification, 
can also restrict the options allowed in the underlying base specification for
satisfying a requirement.

==== ISA Requirements
===== General
* The hypervisor H-extension must be supported.
* The Zam extension must be supported for misaligned addresses within at least aligned 16B regions.
* The `time` CSR must be implemented in hardware.
* The Sstc extension <<spec_priv_sstc>> must be implemented. +

[underline]*_Recommendation_* +
There should be hardware support for all misaligned accesses; misaligned
accesses should not take address misaligned exceptions.

===== Supervisor mode
* satp
** For RV64, Sv48 translation mode must be supported.
** At least 8 ASID bits must be supported and not hardwired to 0.

===== Hypervisor extension
* hgatp
** For RV64, Sv48x4 translation mode must be supported.
** At least 8 VMID bits must be supported and not hardwired to 0.

* vsatp
** For RV64, Sv48 translation mode must be supported.
** At least 8 ASID bits must be supported and not hardwired to 0.

==== PMU

* Counters
** The platform must implement at least 8 programmable counters.
* Events
** Hardware general events
*** The platform must implement all of the general hardware events defined by
the SBI PMU extension.
** Hardware cache events
*** The platform must implement READ operations for all of the hardware cache
events except SBI_PMU_HW_CACHE_NODE and SBI_PMU_HW_CACHE_LL defined in the SBI
PMU extension.
*** The platform must implement WRITE operation for L1D, and DTLB caches.

[sidebar]
--
[underline]*_Implementation Note_*

Any platform that does not implement the micro-architectural features related to
a hardware event may hardwire the event value to zero.
--

==== Debug
The server extension requirements are all of the base specification 
requirements plus:

- Implement at least six mcontrol6 triggers that can support matching on PC
(select=0, execute=1, match=0) with timing=0 and full support for mode
filtering (vs, vu, m, s, u) for all supported modes and support for textra as
above
  * Rationale: Other architectures have found that 4 breakpoints are
    insufficient in more capable systems and recommend 6.
- If system bus access is implemented then accesses must be coherent with
respect to all harts connected to the DM
  * Rationale: Debuggers must be able to view memory coherently.

==== Interrupts and Timer

===== Interrupts support

The server extension must comply with interrupt support described in
<<msis_virtual_msis_and_wired_irqs>> with the following additional 
requirements:

* The H-extension implemented by each hart must support GEILEN = 5 or more.
* Per-hart AIA IMSIC devices.
** Must support at least 255 distinct interrupt identities.
** Must support IPRIOLEN = 8.
* EIID and IID fields of AIA APLIC devices must be at least 8 bits wide
  matching the number of interrupt identities supported by AIA IMSIC.

[underline]*_Recommendation_* +
Platforms should implement at least 5 guest interrupt files. More guest
interrupt files allow for better VM oversubscription on the same hart.

==== Boot Process
=====  Firmware
The boot and system firmware for the server platforms must support UEFI as
defined in the section 2.6.1 of the UEFI Specification <<spec_uefi>> with some
additional requirements described in following sub-sections.

====== UEFI Configuration Tables
The platforms are required to provide following tables:

* *EFI_ACPI_20_TABLE_GUID* ACPI configuration table which is at version 6.4+ or
newer with HW-Reduced ACPI model.
* *SMBIOS3_TABLE_GUID* SMBIOS table which conforms to version 3.4 or later.

====== UEFI Protocol Support
The UEFI protocols listed below are required to be implemented.

|EFI_PCI_IO_PROTOCOL                   | 14.4         | For PCIe support
|===

===== Hardware Discovery Mechanisms

====== ACPI
ACPI is the required mechanism for the hardware discovery and configuration.
Server platforms are required to adhere to the RISC-V ACPI Platform Requirements
Specification <<spec_riscv_acpi>>. Platform firmware must support ACPI and 
the runtime OS environment must use ACPI for device discovery and configuration.

====== SMBIOS
The System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) table is required for the platform
conforming to server extension. The SMBIOS records provide basic hardware and
firmware configuration information used widely by the platform management
applications.

The SMBIOS table is identified using *SMBIOS3_TABLE_GUID* in UEFI configuration
table. The memory type used for the SMBIOS table is required to be of type
*EfiRuntimeServicesData*.

In addition to the conformance guidelines as mentioned in *ANNEX A / 6.2* of
the SMBIOS specification 3.4.0, below additional structures are required.

|===

==== System Peripherals

===== Watchdog Timers
Implementation of a two-stage watchdog timer, as defined in the RISC-V Watchdog
Timer Specification<<spec_riscv_watchdog>> is required. Software must
periodically refresh the watchdog timer, otherwise a first-stage watchdog
timeout occurs. If the watchdog timer remains un-refreshed for a second period,
then a second-stage watchdog timeout occurs.

If a first-stage watchdog timeout occurs, a Supervisor-level interrupt request
is generated and sent to the system interrupt controller, targeting a specific
hart.

If a second-stage watchdog timeout occurs, a system-level interrupt request is
generated and sent to a system component more privileged than Supervisor-mode
such as:

- The system interrupt controller, with a Machine-level interrupt request
targeting a specific hart.
- A platform management processor.
- Dedicated reset control logic.

The resultant action taken is platform-specific.

===== System Date/Time[[SystemDateTime]]
In order to facilitate server manageability, server extension platform is
required to provide the mechanism to maintain system date/time for UEFI
runtime Time service. +

- UEFI Runtime Time Service
  * GetTime() +
    Must be implemented by firmware to incorporate with the underlying system
    date/time mechanism.
  * SetTime(), GetWakeupTime() and SetWakeupTime() +
    These Time services must be implemented but allowed to return
    EFI_UNSUPPORTED if the platform doesn't require the features or the system
    date/time mechanism doesn’t have the capabilities.

===== PCIe
Platforms are required to support at least PCIe Base Specification Revision 1.1
<<spec_pcie_sig>>.

====== PCIe Config Space
* Platforms must support access to the PCIe config space via ECAM as described
in the PCIe Base specification.
* The entire config space for a single PCIe domain must be accessible via a
single ECAM I/O region.
* Platform firmware must implement the MCFG table as listed in the ACPI System
Description Tables above to allow the operating systems to discover the 
supported PCIe domains and map the ECAM I/O region for each domain.
* Platform software must configure ECAM I/O regions such that the effective
memory attributes are that of a PMA I/O region (i.e. strongly-ordered,
non-cacheable, non-idempotent).

====== PCIe Memory Space
Platforms are required to map PCIe address space directly in the system address
space and not have any address translation for outbound accesses from harts or
for inbound accesses to any component in the system address space.

* PCIe Outbound Memory +
PCIe devices and bridges/switches frequently implement BARs which only support
32-bit addressing or support 64 bit addressing but do not support prefetchable
memory. To support mapping of such BARs, platforms are required to reserve
some space below 4G for each root port present in the system.

[sidebar]
--
[underline]*_Implementation Note_* +
Platform software would likely configure these per root port regions such that
their effective memory attributes are that of a PMA I/O region (i.e.
strongly-ordered, non-cacheable, non-idempotent). Platforms would likely also
reserve some space above 4G to map BARs that support 64 bit addressing and
prefetchable memory which could be configured by the platform software as either
I/O or memory.
--

* PCIe Inbound Memory +
For security reasons, platforms with M-mode must provide a mechanism controlled
by M-mode software to restrict inbound PCIe accesses from accessing regions of
address space intended to be accessible only to M-mode software.

[sidebar]
--
[underline]*_Implementation Note_* +
Such an access control mechanism could be analogous to the per-hart PMP
as described in the RISC-V Privileged Architectures specification.
--

====== PCIe Interrupts
* Platforms must support both INTx and MSI/MSI-x interrupts.
* Following are the requirements for INTx:
** For each root port in the system, the platform must map all the INTx
virtual wires to four distinct sources at the APLIC. Each of these sources
must be configured as Level0 as described in Table 4.2 (Encoding of the SM
(Source Mode) field) of the RISC-V AIA specification.
** Platform firmware must implement the _PRT as described in section 6.2.13 of
ACPI Specification to describe the mapping of interrupt pins and the
corresponding interrupt minor identities at the Hart.
** If interrupt generation for correctable/fatal/non-fatal error messages is
enabled via the root error command register of the AER capability and the root
port does not support MSI/MSI-X capability, then the platform is required to
generate an INTx interrupt via the APLIC.
* Following are the requirements for MSI:
** As per the RISC-V AIA specification, since the number 0 is not a valid
interrupt identity, the platform software is required to ensure that MSI data
value assigned to a PCIe function is never 0. For e.g for a PCIe function which
requests 16 MSI vectors the minimum MSI data value assigned by the platform
software can be 0x10 so that the function can use lower 4 bits to assert each
of the 16 vectors.

====== PCIe cache coherency
Memory that is cacheable by harts is not kept coherent by hardware when PCIe
transactions to that memory are marked with a No_Snoop bit of zero. In this
case, software must manage coherency on such memory; otherwise, software
coherency management is not required.

====== PCIe Topology
Platforms are required to implement at least one of the following topologies
and the components required in that topology.

[#fig_intro1]
.PCIe Topologies
image::pcie-topology.png[width=524,height=218]

* Host Bridge +
Following are the requirements for host bridges:

** Any read or write access by a hart to an ECAM I/O region must be converted
by the host bridge into the corresponding PCIe config read or config write
request.
** Any read or write access by a hart to a PCIe outbound region must be
forwarded by the host bridge to a BAR or prefetch/non-prefetch memory window,
if the address falls within the region claimed by the BAR or prefetch/
non-prefetch memory window. Otherwise the host bridge must return an error.

** Host bridge must return all 1s in the following cases:
*** Config read to non existent functions and devices on root bus.
*** Config reads that receive Unsupported Request response from functions and
devices on the root bus.
* Root ports +
Following are the requirements for root ports.
** Root ports must appear as PCI-PCI bridge to software.
** Root ports must implement all registers of Type 1 header.
** Root ports must implement all capabilities specified in the PCIe Base
specification for a root port.
** Root ports must forward type 1 configuration access when the bus number in
the TLP is greater than the root port's secondary bus number and less than or
equal to the root port's subordinate bus number.
** Root ports must convert type 1 configuration access to a type 0
configuration access when bus number in the TLP is equal to the root port's
secondary bus number.
** Root ports must respond to any type 0 configuration accesses it receives.
** Root ports must forward memory accesses targeting its prefetch/non-prefetch
memory windows to downstream components. If address of the transaction does not
fall within the regions claimed by prefetch/non-prefetch memory windows then
the root port must generate a Unsupported Request.
** Root port requester id or completer id must be formed using the bdf of the
root port.
** The root ports must support the CRS software visibility.
** The root port must implement the AER capability.
** Root ports must return all 1s in the following cases:
*** Config read to non existent functions and devices on secondary bus.
*** Config reads that receive Unsupported Request from downstream components.
*** Config read when root port's link is down.

* RCiEP +
All the requirements for RCiEP in the PCIe Base specification must be
implemented.
In addition the following requirements must be met:
** If RCiEP is implemented then RCEC must be implemented as well. All
requirements for RCEC specified in the PCIe Base specification must be
implemented. RCEC is required to terminate the AER and PME messages from RCiEP.
** If both the topologies mentioned above are supported then RCiEP and RCEC
must be implemented in a separate PCIe domain and must be addressable via a
separate ECAM I/O region.

===== PCIe Device Firmware Requirement
PCI expansion ROM code type 3 (UEFI) image must be provided by PCIe device for
OS/A server extension platform according to PCI Firmware 
Specification <<spec_pci_firmware>> if that PCIe device is utilized during 
UEFI firmware boot process. The image stored in PCI expansion ROM is a UEFI 
driver that must be compliant with UEFI specification <<spec_uefi>> 14.4.2 
PCI Option ROMs.


==== Security
Platforms must implement the following security features:

* Support for some form of Secure Boot, as a means to ensure the integrity of
platform firmware and software, is required. Flexibility is provided as
to the many details and implementation approaches. Future platform specs are
expected to standardize some or many of these aspects. For now, it is
recommended that the following security properties are met:
** The secure boot process is rooted in dedicated hardware.
** Cryptographic algorithms are independently validated or certified for
implementation correctness.
** The combination of key length and cryptographic algorithm provides suitable
security strength.
** A cryptographically secure entropy source (or multiple entropy sources) is
used in key material generation and monitoring of entropy source’s health is
implemented.
** Critical security parameters are securely stored and only accessible with
appropriate privileges.
** Authorization is required for any modifications to the platform secure boot
configuration.
** It is clearly understood what aspects of the platform boot process are
protected by secure boot.

** If M-mode is supported in the platform, all machine mode assets, such as
code and data, shall be protected from all non-machine mode accesses from the
harts in the system. Additionally, I/O agent access protection must be 
required within the system to protect machine mode assets. Therefore, the
following requirements are mandatory for platforms with M-mode:

*** Platform must provide a protection mechanism from non-machine mode hart
transactions that precisely traps if violated.
*** Platform must provide a protection mechanism from I/O agents manipulating
or accessing machine mode assets.

==== RAS
All the below mentioned RAS features are required for the OS-A platform server
extension:

*  Main memory must be protected with SECDED-ECC. +
*  All cache structures must be protected. +
** single-bit errors must be detected and corrected. +
** multi-bit errors can be detected and reported. +
* There must be memory-mapped RAS registers associated with these protected
structures to log detected errors with information about the type and location
of the error. +
* The platform must support the APEI specification to convey all error
information to OSPM. +
* Correctable errors must be reported by hardware and either be corrected or
recovered by hardware, transparent to system operation and to software. +
* Hardware must provide status of these correctable errors via RAS registers. +
* Uncorrectable errors must be reported by the hardware via RAS error
registers for system software to take the needed corrective action. +
* Attempted use of corrupted uncorrectable data must result in an exception
 with a distinguishing custom exception code; preferably a precise exception
on that instruction if possible. +
* The platform should provide the capability to configure each RAS
error to trigger firmware-first or OS-first error interrupt. +
* Errors logged in RAS registers must be able to generate an interrupt request
to the system interrupt controller that may be directed to either M-mode or
S/HS-mode for firmware-first or OS-first error reporting. +
* If the RAS error is handled by firmware, the firmware should be able
to choose to expose the error to S/HS mode for further processing or
just hide the error from S/HS software. +
* If the RAS event is configured as the firmware first model, the platform
should be able to trigger the highest priority of M-mode interrupt to all HARTs
in the physical RV processor. +
* Logging and/or reporting of errors can be masked. +
* PCIe AER capability is required. +

// M Platform
== M Platform

=== Scope
The M Platform specification aims to apply to a range of embedded platforms.
In this case embedded platforms range from hand coded bare metal assembly
all the way to to embedded operating systems such as
https://www.zephyrproject.org[Zephyr] and embedded Linux.

This specification has two competing interests. On one hand embedded software
will be easier to write and port if all the embedded hardware is similar. On
the other hand vendors want to differentiate their product and reuse existing
IP and SoC designs.

Due to this, the M Platform specification has both required and recommended
components. All required components must be met in order to meet this
specification.
It's strongly encouraged that all recommended components are met as well,
although they do not have to in order to meet the specification.

=== Base
==== Architecture
The M Platform must comply with the RVM22M profile defined by the RISC-V
profiles specification <<spec_profiles>>.

==== Interrupt Controller
Embedded systems are recommended to use a spec compliant PLIC <<spec_plic>>,
a spec compliant CLIC <<spec_clic>> or both a CLIC and and PLIC.

If using just a PLIC the system must continue to use the original basic
`xsip`/`xtip`/`xeip` signals in the `xip` register to indicate pending
interrupts.
If using the CLIC then both the original basic and CLIC modes of interrupts
must be supported.

Embedded systems cannot use a non-compliant interrupt controller and still
call it a PLIC or CLIC.

==== Timer Support
The M Platform must implement one or more RISC-V ACLINT MTIMER <<spec_aclint>>
devices. This will provide the `mtime` and `mtimecmp` memory mapped registers
as required by the RISC-V privilege specification <<spec_priv>>.

The `mcounteren`.TM and `scounteren`.TM bits _must not_ be hardwired,
regardless as to whether accesses to the `time` CSR are implemented
directly or via traps.

==== Memory Map
It is recommended that main memory and loadable code (not ROM) start at
address `0x8000_0000`.

// PMP extension for M Platform
=== Physical Memory Protection (PMP) Extension
It is recommended that any systems that implement more then just machine mode
also implement PMP support.

When PMP is supported it is recommended to include at least 4 regions, although
if possible more should be supported to allow more flexibility. Hardware
implementations should aim for supporting at least 16 PMP regions.
